 general tips
 1. avoid using the submit button
    atleast  read code once before submiting.
    atleast do dry runs onces for few test cases before submit.
 

 2. newton's first law
    most of lack is consitancy. if body is at rest then it will at rest. if it's motion it will be in motion.
    consistancy is key. solving 1 question weekly is far greater than solving 7 question on one day.

3. weekyly contests is great way to learn[upsolving is important]

4. solve problems that have good reviews 4[likes] : 1[dislike] ratio better.

 strategy

 1. go to a quiet location

 2. pick a question

 3. set a timer for 25 minutes

 4. allocate the first 5 minute to understand to problem(ask / answer clarifying question)

 5. spend the next 20 minutes solving the problem on pen paper

 6. spend the next 10 minutes studying the solution.

 7. stop even if you're in the middle of something importakt like trying to understand the soution.
    do not spend more than 30-35 minutes per question.

 8. record your activity on your progress chart[excel sheet]

 9. revisit the question next week[question that you stuck in first attempt].

 Final most important tip
 It's never too late to start DSA. Don't compare yourself with someone who solving problem from 2-3 years.
 if you specifically targetting tech company interview then compitive programming helps[ cp can be treated
 as superset for all dsa required for tech interview]. you will learn thing while you progress.To master 
 Dp you need to solve 100-200 problems[topic of dp is very vast ].
