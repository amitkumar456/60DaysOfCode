 general tips
 1. avoid using the submit button
    atleast  read code once before submit.
    atleast do dryruns onces for few test cases before submit.
 

 2. newton's first law
    most of lack is consitancy. if body is at rest then it will be rest. if it's motion it will be motion
    consistancy is key. solving 1 question weekly is far greater than solving 7 question on one day.

3. weekyly contests is great way to learn

4. solve problems that have good reviews 4[likes]:1[dislike] ratio better.
